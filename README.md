Here is the link to the website: https://github.com/cseebec/belly-button.github.io

In this repo there are 4 files app.js, index.html, samples.json, and the README.md that you currently have open. 

The samples.json file contains the data that is used to create the website. 

The index.html file creates the basic layout of the website using bootstrap. It also adds headers and some text to the website

The app.js is a javascript file that adds the charts to the website and makes the website interactive. It uses the d3 library to read in the samples.json data and make the website interactive and it uses the plotly library to create the bar chart and the bubble chart.
